This project includes the ability for the player to move around the scene using the left controller and able to look around with the right controller with either a snap or continuous turn (Player movement). There is also a gaze input in which an ai character will follow where you are looking (Gaze input). The player can also grab specific objects using the grab button on the side of the controller, there are also buttons that switch between colours depending on wether you hover or click on them with the right controller (Character interaction). Some other objects will physically interact with the object the player is holding. There is also lights within the scene (Physics & lighting). A user interface system that allows the player to switch between turning style and go from one scene to another (scene management & UI).
